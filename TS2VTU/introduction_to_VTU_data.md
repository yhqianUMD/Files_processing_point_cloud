We have six datasets in the Tetra_Spark framework. In this tutorial, I'll introduce where and how to get each dataset from publicly available website.
* Brain
* Foot
* Stent
* Synthetic
* Lander_small
* Lander_huge

The first four datasets Brain, Foot, Stent, and Synthetic are downloaded from https://klacansky.com/open-scivis-datasets/. After that, we build the umesh project and tetrahedralize the dataset using the provided executable files. The output is a VTU file. To prepare the inputs for Tetra-Spark, we convert the VTU files to TS files using the VTU2TS.py.

We can also convert the TS files to VTU files using the python script TS2VTU_data_format.py

1. Brain
   * brain.ts is generated by using the preprocess-rawfile.py where the input is brain.vtu, and the brain.vtu is produced from the raw image data by tetrahedralization within the Paraview pvpython 
   * barin_data_format.vtu is the VTU file converted from brain.ts using TS2VTU_data_format.py
2. Foot
   * Foot_256_0_percent_mesh.ts is generated from the raw image data by using the preprocess-rawfile.py where the input is brain.vtu
   * Foot_data_format.vtu is the VTU file converted from Foot_256_0_percent_mesh.ts using TS2VTU_data_format.py
3. Stent
   * Stent.vtu is the VTU file generated from the raw image data by tetrahedralization within the Paraview pvpython using the preprocess-rawfile.py where the input is Stent.vtu. e.g., ./pvpython preprocess-rawfile.py /local/data/yuehui/pyspark/Tetra_mesh/data/marchner_lobb_41x41x41_unit8.raw /local/data/yuehui/pyspark/Tetra_mesh/data/marchner_lobb_41x41x41_unit8.vtu
   * Stent.ts is converted from Stent.vtu by using the VTU2TS.py
4. Synthetic
   * Synthetic.vtu is the VTU file generated from the raw image data by tetrahedralization using the preprocess-rawfile.py
   * Synthetic.ts is converted from Synthetic.vtu by using the VTU2TS.py
5. Lander_small
   * Lander_small.vtu is generated from lander-small-vmag-9000.umesh by using the umesh project.
   * Lander_small.ts is converted Lander_small.vtu by using the VTU2TS.py
6. Lander_huge
   * Lander_big.ts is generated by using the preprocess-rawfile.py where the input is Lander_big.vtu, and the Lander_big.vtu is produced from the raw image data by tetrahedralization within the Paraview pvpython
